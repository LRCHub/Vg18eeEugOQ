[00:00.09] Mind
[00:05.09] Mind
[00:07.09] 
[00:19.26] Sittin' all alone
[00:21.66] Mouth full of gum
[00:23.73] In the driveway
[00:28.74] My friends aren't far
[00:31.04] In the back of my car
[00:33.42] Lay their bodies
[00:41.42] 
[00:37.97] Where's my mind?
[00:42.58] Where's my mind?
[00:50.58] 
[00:48.00] They'll be here pretty soon
[00:50.64] Lookin' through my room for the money
[00:57.50] I'm bitin' my nails
[00:59.87] I'm too young to go to jail
[01:02.06] It's kinda funny
[01:10.06] 
[01:06.78] Where's my mind?
[01:11.28] Where's my mind?
[01:16.33] Where's my mind?
[01:20.21] Where's my mind?
[01:28.21] 
[01:25.43] Maybe it's in the gutter
[01:27.80] Where I left my lover
[01:30.12] What an expensive fake
[01:34.73] My V is for Vendetta
[01:37.34] Thought that I'd feel better
[01:39.74] But now I got a bellyache
[01:52.24] 
[01:45.91] Everything I do
[01:48.06] The way I wear my noose
[01:50.18] Like a necklace
[01:55.26] I wanna make 'em scared
[01:57.39] Like I could be anywhere
[01:59.77] Like I'm reckless
[02:08.27] 
[02:04.05] I lost my mind
[02:09.38] I don't mind
[02:13.84] Where's my mind?
[02:17.63] Where's my mind?
[02:25.63] 
[02:22.83] Maybe it's in the gutter
[02:25.48] Where I left my lover
[02:27.57] What an expensive fake
[02:32.14] My V is for Vendetta
[02:34.86] Thought that I'd feel better
[02:37.15] But now I got a bellyache
[02:38.44] (Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
[02:40.20] (Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
[02:56.70] 
[02:42.16] Maybe it's in the gutter
[02:44.51] Where I left my lover
[02:46.97] What an expensive fake
[02:51.43] My V is for Vendetta
[02:54.08] Thought that I'd feel better
[02:56.41] But now I got a bellyache
